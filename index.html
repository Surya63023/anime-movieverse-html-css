        <strong>Plot:</strong>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Demon Slayer Corps leader Kagaya Ubuyashiki and his wife Amane visits
          a graveyard where fallen Demon Slayers are buried. Lamenting those who
          died in the war against Muzan Kibutsuji, he declares that the human
          spirit will always rise to the challenge. Tanjiro Kamado, his demon
          sister Nezuko, and his friends Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira
          board the Mugen Train to assist Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku in
          finding a demon onboard.[N 1] When two demons appear, Kyojuro kills
          them and they are awed by his power and skill. Later, all of them fall
          into a deep sleep, the work of Enmu, Lower Rank One of Muzan's Twelve
          Kizuki.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enmu instructs four insomniac passengers to enter their dreams and
          destroy their spiritual cores, in exchange for a peaceful sleep. The
          Demon Slayers have idealistic dreams; Tanjiro reunites with his
          deceased family, Kyojuro reminisces on his past with his brother and
          father, Zenitsu envisions a life with Nezuko, and Inosuke imagines
          himself as a leader. The intruders fail to destroy their cores, while
          Tanjiro, aided by the unaffected Nezuko, realizes that he is dreaming.
          He abandons his family and wakes up when a vision of his father
          instructs him to commit suicide. Nezuko uses her pyrokinetic Blood
          Demon Art to sever the intruders' connection to the others. Angered at
          being denied their own dreams, they attack Tanjiro, who knocks them
          unconscious except his intruder, after he refused to harm him despite
          suffering from tuberculosis. While Nezuko wakes up the others, Tanjiro
          confronts and beheads Enmu, but he is revealed to have fused with the
          train and prepares to devour the passengers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyojuro instructs Inosuke and Tanjiro to cut Enmu's neck as he,
          Nezuko, and Zenitsu protects the passengers. They find it in the
          locomotive but are attacked by its defenses, including a Blood Demon
          Art that puts them to sleep. The conductor, under Enmu's control,
          stabs Tanjiro in his stomach amidst the chaos. With his mask making
          him immune to Emnu's attacks, Inosuke exposes his vertebra. Tanjiro
          slashes it with his newfound Hinokami Kagura, killing Enmu and
          derailing the train. As Tanjiro attempts to recover from his wound,
          Kyojuro teaches him how to stabilize it with his breathing techniques.
          They are then confronted by Upper Rank Three Akaza, who tries to
          persuade Kyojuro into becoming a demon. Kyojuro refuses and fights
          Akaza, but he cannot overcome his regeneration and is severely wounded
          as Tanjiro and Inosuke look on. After attempting his most powerful
          move as a last resort, Akaza fatally injures him by impaling his solar
          plexus. With his remaining strength, Kyojuro attempts to restrain
          Akaza until sunrise and sever his neck, but Akaza breaks free and
          flees into a nearby forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tanjiro throws his sword at Akaza and impales his chest, though he
          escapes. He breaks down, calling the demon a coward and declaring
          Kyojuro victorious for fulfilling his duty to keep everyone safe. In
          his last moments, Kyojuro tells Tanjiro to visit his family's estate
          to ascertain writings from the past Flame Hashiras, which may help him
          learn about his Hinokami Kagura. He encourages Tanjiro and his friends
          to continue on their paths to greater strength, telling them to never
          give up in protecting others, before succumbing to his injuries and
          reuniting with his mother in the afterlife. While Tanjiro and his
          friends mourn Kyojuro's death, the Hashira receive the news. Kagaya
          honors him for not letting anyone else die in his presence, stating
          that he will be glad to reunite with him when he too passes.

          <strong><span class="highlight">Spirited Away</span> (2001)</strong>,
          directed by <u><strong>Hayao Miyazaki</strong></u
          >, <mark>earned around $395 million worldwide</mark>. It remains a
          timeless Studio Ghibli masterpiece.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spirited Away</strong> is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy
          film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It was produced by Toshio
          Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli, and distributed by Toho.[7] The
          film stars Rumi Hiiragi, alongside Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki, Takashi
          Naito, Yasuko Sawaguchi, Tsunehiko Kamijō, Takehiko Ono, and Bunta
          Sugawara. It follows a young girl named Chihiro "Sen" Ogino, who moves
          to a new neighborhood and inadvertently enters the world of kami
          (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore).[8] After her parents are turned
          into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's
          bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to
          the human world. Miyazaki wrote the screenplay after he decided the
          film would be based on the ten-year-old daughter of his friend Seiji
          Okuda, the film's associate producer, who came to visit his house each
          summer.[9] At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects,
          but they were rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of
          Spirited Away began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and
          friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's
          North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer
          of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as
          director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy
          and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the
          characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.
        </p>
        <strong>Plot:</strong>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents Akio and Yūko travel to
          their new home. Akio, taking a shortcut, stops in front of a tunnel
          leading to what appears to be an abandoned resort town, which Yūko
          insists on exploring over Chihiro's protestations. Upon finding a
          seemingly empty restaurant stocked with food, Chihiro's parents
          immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an
          enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return
          across the riverbed before sunset. However, spirits begin to appear,
          and Chihiro discovers that her parents have been transformed into pigs
          and that she cannot cross the now-flooded river. Haku finds Chihiro
          and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man,
          Kamaji, a yōkai spirit commanding soot sprites known as susuwatari.
          Kamaji instead asks a worker named Lin to bring Chihiro to Kamaji's
          master Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse and who cursed
          Chihiro's parents. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away but
          eventually gives her a work contract. As Chihiro signs the contract
          with her name (千尋), Yubaba takes away the second kanji in her name,
          renaming her Sen (千). She soon forgets her real name, and Haku later
          explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if Chihiro
          completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to
          leave the spirit world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other workers, except for Kamaji and Lin, frequently mock Sen.
          While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside,
          believing him to be a customer. The spirit of a polluted river arrives
          as Sen's first customer. After she cleans him, he gives her a magic
          emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face demands
          food from the bathhouse workers, granting gold copied from the river
          spirit in exchange. However, when Sen declines the gold and leaves to
          find Haku, No-Face angrily swallows some workers. Sen sees paper
          shikigami spirits attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as a
          metamorphosed Haku. When the seriously injured Haku crashes into
          Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed
          away on her back shapeshifts into Yubaba's twin sister Zeniba, who
          turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse and creates a false copy of him.
          Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her
          that carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing
          Zeniba to vanish. Sen and Haku fall into the boiler room, where she
          feeds him part of the emetic dumpling. He vomits up the seal and a
          slug that a disgusted Sen kills. Sen resolves to return the seal and
          apologize to Zeniba. She confronts an engorged No-Face and feeds him
          the rest of the dumpling, forcing him to regurgitate the workers.
          No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, and Lin helps them leave.
          Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba using train tickets from
          Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba nearly orders Sen's parents slaughtered, but
          Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba
          releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass
          a final test.
        </p>
        <p>
          The train crosses a sea to a land where Sen meets Zeniba, who reveals
          that Yubaba used the slug to control Haku. Zeniba tells Sen that she
          can't help her parents, but she makes her a magic protective hairband.
          Using his dragon form, Haku flies Sen and Boh back, while No-Face
          decides to stay with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen recalls falling into the
          Kohaku River years earlier and being washed safely ashore, correctly
          guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River and
          restoring his memory. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba tests
          Sen, asking her to identify her parents among a group of pigs. After
          she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her
          contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes
          her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro
          crosses the riverbed to her restored parents. Shortly before leaving
          for her new home, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, still wearing her
          hairband from Zeniba.

        <strong>Plot:</strong>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school student in Itomori,[note 1] a rural
          town in the Gifu prefecture of central Japan. Having grown bored of
          her provincial life, she wishes to be reborn as a boy from Tokyo.
          Soon,[c] she begins to intermittently switch bodies with Taki
          Tachibana, a high school student (and part-time waiter) from Tokyo's
          ward of Shinjuku. On certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each
          other's bodies and must live the entire day as the other, reverting
          when they sleep. The two set up ground rules for sharing their bodies,
          communicating via writing messages on paper, their phones, and their
          skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his
          coworker, Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) helps Mitsuha
          become more popular at school. While in Mitsuha's body, Taki
          accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to
          a Shinto shrine in the Goshintai[note 2] crater near Itomori,[d]
          leaving an offering of kuchikamizake fermented with Mitsuha's saliva.
          Hitoha explains that God is sovereign over both time and the
          connections between humans. Mitsuha informs Taki[e] that the comet
          Tiamat is expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn
          festival. The next day,[f] Taki goes on a date (at the National Art
          Center in Roppongi) with Okudera in his own body; Okudera enjoys the
          date but says she can tell Taki is preoccupied with someone else,
          owing to his unusual behavior. Realizing he is falling for Mitsuha,[g]
          Taki attempts to dial her number, but cannot reach her. The
          body-switching stops as inexplicably as it started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taki, Okudera, and his classmate Tsukasa Fujii travel to Hida to
          search for Mitsuha.[h] As Taki does not know the name of her village,
          he sketches its landscape from memory. A ramen-shop owner in Takayama
          recognizes the town as Itomori and offers to take the trio there. When
          they arrive, they find the town completely in ruins (with Mitsuha's
          messages simultaneously vanishing from his phone), having been almost
          entirely decimated by fragments that fell from Tiamat. Since the comet
          passed three years earlier, Taki realizes that he and Mitsuha were
          separated by three years, with her living in 2013 and him in 2016. At
          Hida City Library, the three discover that Mitsuha, her family
          members, and friends were among the five-hundred victims killed by the
          comet's impact. Taki then begins to lose his memories of Mitsuha.
          Frantically, Taki leaves his inn accommodation[i] and rushes to the
          shrine at Goshintai to imbibe Mitsuha's kuchikamizake. Upon doing so,
          he faints, undergoing a vision chronicling much of her life, and
          realizes that she once came to Tokyo to find him.[j] Although he was
          unaware of whom she was, she passed her crimson kumihimo braid to him,
          which he has worn as a good-luck bracelet ever since. He then awakens
          in Mitsuha's body on the morning of the festival.[k] Hitoha undergoes
          an epiphany upon observing "Mitsuha's" uncharacteristic behavior;
          speaking directly to Taki, she reveals that the body-switching
          phenomenon has been in their family for centuries. Realizing he has a
          chance to save Mitsuha and the entire town, Taki convinces Mitsuha's
          friends, Sayaka and Tessie, to assist in broadcasting an emergency
          signal to evacuate Itomori before the meteor fragments strike. He then
          rushes to the shrine, where Mitsuha has just woken up in Taki's body.
          As twilight falls,[note 3] their timelines intersect, allowing them to
          finally meet in person. Taki returns Mitsuha's braid, and they attempt
          to write their names on each other's palms, but twilight ends before
          Mitsuha can write hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Returning to Itomori by foot, Mitsuha observes that the evacuation
          plan had failed. She then successfully convinces the mayor, her
          estranged father Toshiki, to order an evacuation drill. Beginning to
          forget Taki, she discovers that he had written "I love you" on her
          hand instead of his name.[note 4] Taki awakens in his own time with no
          memory of Mitsuha.[l] Five years later, Taki, who has graduated from
          university, struggles to find a job: he is haunted by persistent
          feelings of longing and emptiness.[m] He has continuously fixated on
          the impact of Tiamat, from which the residents of Itomori were
          miraculously saved by a fortuitous evacuation drill, but is unable to
          determine why. Eventually, on April 8, 2022, he glimpses Mitsuha, who
          has moved to Tokyo, on a parallel metro train, and they race to find
          each other. On the steps of Suga Shrine [ja], Taki calls out to
          Mitsuha, and the two simultaneously ask for each other's names,
          declaiming the film's title (Your Name).

          >
          is a 2022 Japanese animated coming-of-age fantasy adventure film
          written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. The third and final
          installment of Shinkai's disaster trilogy, following Your Name (2016)
          and Weathering with You (2019), the film follows 17-year-old high
          school girl Suzume Iwato and young stranger Souta Munakata, who team
          up to prevent a series of disasters across Japan by sealing doors from
          the colossal, supernatural worm that causes earthquakes after being
          released. Produced by CoMix Wave Films, it features the voices of
          Nanoka Hara and Hokuto Matsumura, with character designs by Masayoshi
          Tanaka, animation direction by Kenichi Tsuchiya, art direction by
          Takumi Tanji, and its musical score was composed by Radwimps and
          Kazuma Jinnouchi, making it Shinkai's third collaboration with Tanaka
          and Radwimps. The film began production in early 2020, eventually
          being announced as completed by October 2022. Its themes were inspired
          by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. A novel adaptation, also
          written by Shinkai, and a manga series illustrated by Denki Amashima
          both debuted prior to the film's release. Suzume first premiered in
          IMAX in Japan on November 7, 2022, followed by a theatrical release by
          Toho on November 11. It received largely positive reviews from
          critics, with praise directed towards the characters, animation,
          visuals, music, and emotional story. The film grossed over US$314
          million worldwide, making it the fourth highest-grossing Japanese film
          of all time as well as the fourth highest-grossing film of 2022 in
          Japan. Among its numerous accolades, the film was nominated for Best
          Animated Feature at the 81st Golden Globe Awards and received seven
          nominations at the 51st Annie Awards losing to both The Boy and the
          Heron (2023) and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)
          respectively.

        <strong>Plot: </strong>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Suzume Iwato is a high-school girl living with her aunt Tamaki in a
          town in Kyushu. She has recurring dreams of her childhood self walking
          through a ruined cityscape at night, before running into a shadowy
          figure resembling her late mother. On her way to school one morning,
          Suzume meets a young man searching for abandoned locations with doors,
          and tells him of a nearby abandoned onsen resort. Following him there,
          Suzume discovers a free-standing door, which she opens to find a
          starlit field that she cannot enter. She trips over a cat statue on
          the floor, which turns into a real cat and flees. Frightened, Suzume
          rushes to school. During lunch, Suzume notices a huge column of smoke
          from the location of the abandoned resort, which no one else can see.
          She returns there and finds the man from earlier struggling to close
          the door through which the smoke is escaping. Suzume helps him lock
          the door with an old key. The smoke disappears, but not before causing
          earthquake damage to the town.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suzume takes the injured man, Souta Munakata, to her home. He explains
          that he is a "Closer" and must locate and lock specific doors in
          abandoned places throughout Japan to prevent a supernatural "worm"
          from being released and causing earthquakes. As they talk, the cat
          from the resort appears and turns Souta into the chair he was sitting
          on. Souta, now an animated three-legged chair, chases the cat onto a
          ferry headed for Ehime, with Suzume following. Souta tells Suzume that
          the cat is a "keystone", and that the worm was released after the
          keystone's removal from the resort door. Upon reaching Ehime, Suzume
          and Souta find social media posts from locals, who have photographed
          and named the cat "Daijin". They locate the worm again and close the
          door it is escaping from in an abandoned school. Suzume and Souta
          hitch a ride to Kobe, and Daijin leads them to an abandoned amusement
          park, where they stop the worm from emerging again through a Ferris
          wheel gondola. Souta explains that the portal within the doors leads
          to the Ever-After, where souls go after death.
        </p>
        <p>
          After tracking Daijin to Tokyo, Souta asks Suzume to take them to his
          apartment. He explains the legend of the worm, and that he is the last
          descendant of a family that, for generations, had been responsible for
          locking doors which lead to the Ever-After. Souta speaks of two
          keystones that seal the worm: the western keystone has become Daijin,
          while the location of the eastern keystone is unknown. He warns that
          if the worm tries to emerge in Tokyo, it could cause damage similar to
          the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Suzume notices the worm emerging
          again, and the two head towards it. Daijin reappears and reveals that
          he has passed on his function as keystone to Souta. Souta suddenly
          turns into the new keystone and Suzume reluctantly uses him to seal
          the worm. Awakening at a shrine housing the Tokyo gate, Suzume sees
          Souta within the Ever-After but is unable to enter. Suzume visits
          Souta's grandfather Hitsujirō at the hospital, hoping to discover how
          to rescue Souta. Hitsujirō explains that Suzume's ability to see the
          worm and the Ever-After through the doors means that at some point in
          her life she entered the realm through one such door. Moreover, the
          doorway she first used is the only place where she can re-enter the
          Ever-After.

          2022 Japanese animated sports film written and directed by Takehiko

        <strong>Plot: </strong>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Hanamichi Sakuragi is a high school delinquent and gang leader. He is
          very unpopular among girls, having been rejected fifty times. In his
          first year at Shohoku High School, Sakuragi meets Haruko Akagi, the
          girl of his dreams, and is overjoyed when she is not repulsed or
          frightened of him like other girls. Haruko recognizes Sakuragi's
          athleticism and introduces him to the Shohoku basketball team.
          Sakuragi is reluctant to play basketball due to his inexperience with
          sports and his belief that basketball is a game for losers. This
          belief came about because the most recent girl to reject him had
          favored a basketball player. Despite his immaturity and temper, he
          joins the team to impress Haruko, and proves to be a natural athlete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sakuragi later develops a genuine love for the sport despite initially
          playing because of his crush. Around this time, the star rookie and
          "girl magnet" Kaede Rukawa joins the team. Sakuragi views him as a
          bitter rival in basketball and romance, as Haruko has an unrequited
          crush on Rukawa. Shortly after, two additional members rejoin the
          team: Hisashi Mitsui, a skilled three-point shooter and ex–junior high
          school MVP; and Ryota Miyagi, a short but fast point guard. The four
          players work together to fulfill team captain Takenori Akagi's dream
          of winning the national championship. After defeating one of the
          powerhouse teams at the national high school championship, the misfits
          gain publicity, and the once little-known Shohoku basketball team
          becomes an all-star contender in Japan.
